- answer: '1. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged into rows and columns,
    commonly denoted by an uppercase letter (e.g., A).

    2. Each number in a matrix is termed an element or entry, typically denoted by
    A(i,j), representing the value at the i-th row and j-th column.

    3. Matrices are essential computational tools for representing linear transformations,
    systems of linear equations, and operations such as rotations or scaling in numerical
    linear algebra.

    4. The size (dimension) of a matrix is given by the number of rows (m) and the
    number of columns (n), described as an m-by-n matrix.'
  question: What is a matrix?
- answer: '1. A real symmetric n-by-n matrix A is positive definite if for every nonzero
    vector x, the quadratic form x^T A x > 0.

    2. Equivalently, all eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix A are strictly
    positive.

    3. Another numerical characterization: A can be decomposed using the Cholesky
    decomposition as A = L L^T, with L lower triangular and nonsingular.

    4. Computationally, positive definiteness ensures numerically stable methods (e.g.,
    Cholesky) for solving linear systems.

    5. Positive definiteness also implies convexity of the quadratic form, relevant
    in optimization.'
  question: What is a positive definite matrix?
- answer: '1. The Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem provides the best low-rank approximation
    of a matrix A under the Euclidean norm.


    2. Specifically, given matrix A (m x n) with singular value decomposition (SVD)
    A = U Σ V^T and singular values σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ ... ≥ σ_r ≥ 0, the rank-k matrix A_k
    = Σ (σ_i u_i v_i^T), summed from i = 1 to k, minimizes ‖A - B‖₂ over all rank-k
    matrices B.


    3. In other words, A_k formed by taking the first k singular values and corresponding
    singular vectors gives the optimal approximation in terms of minimal spectral
    norm error.'
