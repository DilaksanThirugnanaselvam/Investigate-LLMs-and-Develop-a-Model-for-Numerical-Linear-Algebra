- question: What is a matrix?
  answer: 1. A matrix A∈ℝᵐˣⁿ is a rectangular array of scalars aᵢⱼ with i=1,…,m and j=1,…,n.  
    2. It represents a linear map from ℝⁿ to ℝᵐ via y=A x, where x∈ℝⁿ and y∈ℝᵐ.  
    3. Standard operations include addition (O(mn)), scalar multiplication (O(mn)), and matrix–matrix multiplication (O(m n p) for A∈ℝᵐˣⁿ, B∈ℝⁿˣᵖ).  
    4. Matrices encode systems of linear equations, transformations, and serve as fundamental data structures in numerical linear algebra.
- question: What is a positive definite matrix?
  answer: 1. A is an n×n real symmetric matrix.  
    2. For every nonzero vector x in Rⁿ, the quadratic form xᵀ A x is strictly positive (xᵀ A x > 0).  
    3. Equivalently, all eigenvalues of A are positive.  
    4. Equivalently, A admits a unique Cholesky factorization A = Rᵀ R with R upper triangular and positive diagonal.
- question: What is the Eckart-Young-Mirsky Theorem?
  answer: 1. Let A ∈ R^{m×n} have singular value decomposition A = U Σ Vᵀ with Σ = diag(σ₁,…,σ_r), σ₁ ≥ … ≥ σ_r > 0.  
    2. For k < r define Σ_k = diag(σ₁,…,σ_k,0,…,0) and A_k = U Σ_k Vᵀ.  
    3. Eckart‐Young‐Mirsky Theorem: A_k minimizes ||A – B|| among all B of rank ≤ k for any unitarily invariant norm.  
    4. In particular, ||A – A_k||₂ = σ_{k+1}, and ||A – A_k||_F = sqrt(∑_{i>k} σ_i²).
